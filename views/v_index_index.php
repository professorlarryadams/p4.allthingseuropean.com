<h2>Project Oview</h2>
<p>According to the Government Accounting Office (GAO) the United Srtates Government will watse over 440 million dollars in one year in printed publications.  Not to mention the processing of applications that will need to be archive which could drive the costs over a billion dollars.  Federal laws like the Paper Elimation and Reduction Acts have done very little to reduce the cost.  Now the White House and OMB are pushing e-government stratgeies that will finally address the major cost of a paper world.  This project is one of many solution to submit application online through a secure connection which will allow the process to be totally paperless.
The cost for the application $5 to $10 per month.</p>
