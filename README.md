Project 4

Creating secure online forms to eliminate the need for paper in the federal government.  These forms are to help federal agencies to comply with federal laws to eliminate the need for paper and to support the White Houses E-Government strategy
.

HowTo.gov is a GSA website which helps government agencies to better understand all the federal manatees regarding public government websites.

I am using my class projects at Harvard University to show that it is possible for under $10 a month to create a secure online form that would eliminate the need for paper applications.

Sincerely,

Larry Adams
Graduate student at Harvard University
